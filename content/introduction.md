# Introduction

## Description

As data-based research becomes a common practice, skills in data management, data analysis, and computational thinking are increasingly important for applied researchers. The Graduate Student Research Data Bootcamp will provide incoming and continuing graduate students with a gentle introduction to data and programming-related research tools that will increase their access to cutting-edge methods as they begin their programs and research. Topics covered include reproducible research (especially using containerization tools such as Docker); collaboration and version control (using Git and Github); data analysis and visualization fundamentals in Python and R; and an overview of publishing platforms, impact, and scholarly communication
